# Projects & Certification

Completion of the training program is contingent upon the successful delivery of a capstone project.

## Requirements

### Team Structure

Projects are to be executed in teams. We encourage diverse skill sets within each team to handle logic, integration, and architecture.

### Normal Track Timeline

* **Proposal:** Teams must submit a project proposal **one month** before the training concludes.
* **Scope:** Projects must utilize concepts covered in the curriculum (MeTTa, Atomspace).
* **Evaluation:** Projects will be presented during the final sessions (Sessions 52-56).

### Fast Track Timeline

* **Formation:** Teams are formed immediately following the first month of the fast track.
* **Execution:** Teams have one month to execute and deliver the project.

## Certification Criteria

Certificates are awarded based on:

1. **Technical Implementation:** Correct usage of MeTTa and MORK.
2. **Attendance:** Adherence to the attendance policy (< 3 absences).
3. **Project Delivery:** Successful presentation and functionality of the final build.
